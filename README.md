# 🗓️ Convene

**Convene** is a collaborative scheduling web application that helps teams find the best time to meet based on everyone's availability. Users can select their available time ranges across the week, and Convene will suggest and rank the optimal meeting times where multiple team members are available.

## 🌟 Features

- **Full Week Scheduling**  
  Select your availability for all seven days of the week — starting from **Sunday** through **Saturday**.

- **Interactive Calendar UI**  
  A clean, intuitive, and responsive calendar interface that makes selecting time ranges simple and interactive.

- **Room-Based Collaboration**  
  Create or join shared calendars using a **unique room code**, making it easy for teams to collaborate on availability without needing accounts.

- **Smart Meeting Suggestions**  
  Once all users submit their availability, Convene generates time slot options where **at least two users** are available.

- **Ranked Meeting Options**  
  Meeting times are automatically ranked:
  - ✅ **Best**: All users are available  
  - 👍 **Good**: Most users are available  
  - 👥 **Minimum**: At least two users are available  
  Each suggested time includes the **names of users available** during that time slot.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Join or Create a Room:** Share a room code to invite others to a shared calendar.

2. **Mark Your Availability:** Use the interactive calendar to select time ranges for each day of the week and save your availability.

3. **Generate Meeting Suggestions:** Convene analyzes all inputs and finds overlapping availability.

4. **View & Choose Ranked Options:** Browse suggested meeting times with clear visibility of who’s available and select the best option.
